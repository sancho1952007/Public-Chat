### FAQ  
<details>
<summary>Why did you build it?</summary>
I always wanted a platform where everyone of this world could come at one place and chat on the same topic. This will also prevent misinformation as multiple people are on the same topic at the very same time.
</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you handle profanity & threats?</summary>
Public Chat is integrated with a high end, fast and optimized AI model named Qwen AI v2.5, a 72B parameter model that can analyse the whole message within 2-4 seconds. This ensures the platform is safe from profanity, threats and spam.

It's 100% free of charge to use.
